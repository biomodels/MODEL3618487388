**Abstract:**   
We describe the construction and analysis of a genome-scale metabolic model of
_Arabidopsis thaliana_ primarily derived from the annotations in the Aracyc
database. We used techniques based on Linear Programming to demonstrate that:
1) the model is capable of producing biomass components (amino-acids,
nucleotides, lipid, starch and cellulose) in the proportion observed
experimentally in a heterotrophic suspension culture ; 2) That, approximately,
only 15 % of the available reactions are needed for this purpose and that the
size of this network is comparable to estimates of minimal network size for
other organisms ; 3) That reactions may be grouped according to the changes in
flux resulting from a hypothetical stimulus (in this case demand for ATP), and
that this allows the identification of potential metabolic modules ; 4) That
total ATP demand for growth and maintenance can be inferred, and that this is
consistent with previous estimates in prokaryotes and yeast.
